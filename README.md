# pla-devel
Development code for the PLA project at Michigan, all in R. A master file keeps arranges and organizes analysis of the main questions posed in the course. Larger pieces of code (e.g. grade.penalty.module.R) are broken into separate files, which we may decide later to paste into the master file, or to keep separate. The final products will be transfered to a separate repository or forked for the live PLA-MOOC.

master.analysis.R: Intended to be a master/main level wrapper for all relevant questions and modules in the course.

grade.penalty.module.R: Grade penalty analysis. Requires the optmatch package.

course.persistence.module.R: Course to course persistence.
